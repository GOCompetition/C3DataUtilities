ðŸš§ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§ðŸš§

Currently relies on https://github.com/Smart-DS/Bid-DS-data-model. Follow installation directions in that repository, primarily:

```
cd Bid-DS-data-model
pip install -e .
```

The validators branch (https://github.com/Smart-DS/Bid-DS-data-model/tree/validators) contains the most complete set of input data checking, but this will later be merged into main. Once Bid-DS-data-model is installed, one can do:

```
cd C3DataUtilities
python check_data.py <problem_data_file_name>
```

This will read a problem data file, check it against properties specified in the data format document and problem formulation document, and print out some information about the problem dimensions. If the data fails any of the required properties, an exception will be raised to report this. It is not guaranteed that all failed properties will be reported. If there is at least one failure, then it is guaranteed that at least one failure will be reported.

The operative parts of ```check_data.py``` for data checking are:

```
from datamodel.input.data import InputDataFile
```

and

```
problem_data = InputDataFile.load(problem_data_file_name)
```

and

```
check_data_model(problem_data)
```

```datamodel``` is the Python module contained in Bid-DS-data-model. If no errors are raised by ```load```, then ```problem_data``` is a Pydantic model object containing the problem data, and no errors were found at reat time. ```check_data_model``` performs additional data checks after reading the data file, and any errors it finds are also raised.
